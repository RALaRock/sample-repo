# dictionary is a composite data type like a list
# both are mutable, itemso can be changed
# both are dynamic, can change size
# both can be nested, both can contain other lists or dictionaries
# lists and dictionary differ
# list elements are accessed by their index in the list
# dictionary elements are accessed by their keys
# a dictionary is also called an associative array
# it is a collection of key-value pairs

# defining a dictionary, enclose comma separated list in curly braces
# a semi colon separates each key value pair
# d = {
#     key: value,
#     key: value,
#     key: value, # include the trailing comma to maintain this format
